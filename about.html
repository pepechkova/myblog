        <p>Rome was called the <strong>“Eternal City”</strong> by the ancient Romans because they believed that no matter what happened
            in the rest of the world, the city of Rome would always remain standing. Exploring the city centre by foot
            surrounded by glorious monuments and colossal remains takes you back in time to the “glory that was Rome”.
        </p>
    
        <p>With its unparalleled history, Rome is the third most visited city in Europe and the fourteenth
            worldwide. It attracts visitors from all over the world who are impatient to discover the city’s
            impressive monuments and archaeological sites; not to mention its renowned cuisine and its lively
            atmosphere.</p>


        <p>When exploring the Colosseum, visitors will easily imagine how the gladiators fought for their life in
            the arena, cheered by the crowd. In the Circus Maximus, travelers will picture the chariots crashing
            into each other in order to be first in the race, and in the Roman Forum visualise what the Roman public
            life was like.</p>
