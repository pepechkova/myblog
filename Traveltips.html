        <h4>Always carry cash</h4>

    <p>Italy still largely functions on a cash economy, so be sure to carry cash with you during your time in
        Rome.
        Coins, or spicci, are especially welcome at cafés small shops.</p>

        <h4>Buy bus tickets ahead of time</h4>

        <p>If you need to take a bus in the city centre, be
            sure to stock up on bus tickets ahead of time because you can’t buy them on the bus. You can buy tickets
            at
            any tabaccheria in the city, little convenient shops that are designated with a large T. Tickets are
            €1.50
            each, or opt for a 24-hour, 48-hour or weekly ticket for a discounted price. Tickets are valid for all
            forms
            of public transportation in Rome (bus, metro, tram and local train).</p>

            <h4>Free museums on first Sundays</h4>

            <p>Rome’s state-owned museums, galleries, archeological sites, parks and gardens are free on the first
                Sunday of each month, so be sure to drop by and soak in some art if you’re in town these days.</p>

            <h3>Buy Vatican tickets online to skip the line</h3>

            <div class="media">
                <img
                    src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531572753322-ad063cecc140?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80">
            </div>

            <p>Housing one of the world’s greatest collections, the Vatican Museums are one of Italy’s most popular
                attractions and attract over 5 million people per year. Though you’ll inevitably face a crowd, you can
                skip the long lines by purchasing your museum tickets on the Vatican website. The extra €4 for booking
                online is well worth the time you’ll save waiting in line.</p>
        
            <h3>Don’t count on WiFi</h3>

            <div class="media">
                <img
                    src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460794418188-1bb7dba2720d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80">
            </div>

            <p>The internet is spotty around Rome and even hotels, cafes and restaurants that advertise free WiFi can’t
                always guarantee coverage. Consider signing up for an international coverage plan while you’re in the
                city or bringing a portable hotspot with you if you need it to get around or for work. Note that coffee
                shops with WiFi are also few and far between, although there are a few around the city (Barnum Café and
                Analemma are two of the most popular spots for freelancers).</p>


        
            <h3>Dinner starts late</h3>

            <div class="media">
                <img
                    src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516100882582-96c3a05fe590?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80">
            </div>

            <p>Drinking and dining are important rituals in Italy and meals tend to start later than normal (and last
                for longer) than in other countries. In the evenings, Italians usually meet friends or colleagues for an
                aperitivo around 7pm, which consists of a drink and some light snacks, before going to dinner around
                8-9pm. On the weekends, it’s not uncommon to arrive to a restaurant around 10pm.</p>
